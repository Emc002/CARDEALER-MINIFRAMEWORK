    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
      Ford is a family company, one that spans the globe and has shared ideals. We value service to each other and the
      world as much as to our customers.
      Generations have made their memories with us and included us in their hopes and dreams. After 117 years,
      we're used to adapting to and leading change. That's why we're evolving to focus on services, experiences and
      software as well as vehicles.</p>
